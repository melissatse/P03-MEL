        <h2>Finding parking spots can be especially difficult and many drivers end up wasting a lot of time during their busy schedules circling around lots. Our aim is to make this end part less of an inconvenience.</h2>

				<p> Our idea is to create a parking reservation
					application, where you can look at parking lot
					locations with their rates and then select and
					reserve your parking spot on a graphical interface.</p>

							<h3>Users</h3>
							<p>Our design domain is transportation and we are specifically focusing on driving. From interviews and surveys, we found there were many issues with driving that our design domain faced, however, parking was an issue brought up several times and a problem that resonated with us personally. Using our findings as a framework, we were able to better understand the struggles of this domain.</p>

                <h3>Concerns</h3>
                <p>Regulation concerns
									could deem the application useless. Thus, we want to ensure how we can implement this idea in a manner
									that is acceptable. To perform this, we would research parking lots such as Impark to help us assess the situation better</p>

                <h3>Information Management</h3>
                <p>To make the idea fully functional, the parking information will need to be completely updated. Therefore, we need to understand the varying durations that parking lots have for vehicle movement. Knowing this could help us to apply time restrictions, if necessary</p>

                <p>Countless iterations were made to suit the target domain we were designing for. Through this process I was able to gain insight on how important the inital research is. </p>

                <p>To further develop ParkEasy, creating an application that could be extended to work on the existing GPS would be convenient.</p>

                <p>I was able to learn new programs in the process of creating ParkEasy as well as being able to  develop my research skills which can be carried forward to future projects.</p>
