										<h2>First impressions always leave a lasting impact. So, it’s essential to make sure that they are a true reflection of who you are.</h2>

										<p>The new landing page presents a coherent and consistent reflection of Lumen and illustrates an overview of Lumen and their system. Visitors are presented with humanized testimonials and given an overview of the transaction process beforehand. </p>

										<p>To further develop Lumen's new landing page creating a reusable section for new feature updates would help existing customers stay up to date.</p>

										<p>I was able to learn new programs in the process of creating Lumen's new landing page. Working in a team with a real-world company also gave me insights on how studio work feels like.</p>
